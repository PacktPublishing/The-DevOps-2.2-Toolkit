# The DevOps 2.2 Toolkit
This is the code repository for [The DevOps 2.2 Toolkit](https://www.packtpub.com/business/devops-22-toolkit?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788991278), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Building on The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit and The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Docker Swarm, Viktor Farcic brings his latest exploration of the Docker technology as he records his journey to explore two new programs, self-adaptive and self-healing systems within Docker.

The DevOps 2.2 Toolkit: Self-Sufficient Docker Clusters is the latest book in Viktor Farcicâ€™s series that helps you build a full DevOps Toolkit. This book in the series looks at Docker, the tool designed to make it easier in the creation and running of applications using containers. In this latest entry, Viktor combines theory with a hands-on approach to guide you through the process of creating self-adaptive and self-healing systems.

Within this book, Viktor will cover a wide-range of emerging topics, including what exactly self-adaptive and self-healing systems are, how to choose a solution for metrics storage and query, the creation of cluster-wide alerts and what a successful self-sufficient system blueprint looks like.

Work with Viktor and dive into the creation of self-adaptive and self-healing systems within Docker.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
docker service create \
 --name util \
 --network monitor \
 --mode global \
 alpine sleep 100000000
